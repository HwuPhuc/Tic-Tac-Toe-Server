# Tic-Tac-Toe Server
A tic-tac-toe game created by using Java for learning purpose.

The aim is to understand how to make an online game where players can connect to each other through Internet and play together.

Using only a text file (.txt) to store player informations (account, password, username, statistics...) since the project is focusing on create a connection between users (Would change the method of storing data if I have time)

Make sure to run the main file on the Tic-Tac-Toe Server folder (project) first, so that the code from Tic-Tac-Toe Client repo (project) could run properly.
